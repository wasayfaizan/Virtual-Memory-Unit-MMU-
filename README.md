# Virtual-Memory-Unit-MMU

This program will read from a file containing logical addresses and, using a TLB and a page table, translates each logical address to its corresponding physical address and output the value of the byte stored at the translated physical address. This will include resolving page faults using demand paging, managing a TLB, and implementing a page-replacement algorithm.
